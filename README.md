# Graphene

A simple simple asynchronous file explorer.

A developer should not be hindered by their file explorer.

Graphene allows you to easily browse your project, folder by folder, creating
files, moving them around, and perhaps most importantly: opening them.

Graphene is **not** a tree viewer. The mind only has so much capacity, and as
such, Graphene focuses on your immediate surroundings letting you be focused on
the files at hand.
